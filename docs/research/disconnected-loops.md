# Closing disconnected polyline boundaries (Make2D rescue)

## Concrete failure case

private architecture section regression drawing, layer
`Visible::ClippingPlaneIntersections::TEC_FOUNDATION`: 10 line segments,
should form one closed cut boundary of the building foundation. Bare
`shapely.ops.linemerge` chains 0 of them — endpoints don't share within any
sane tolerance.

## Strategy ladder

| # | Strategy | Confidence | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `linemerge` (no snap) + `polygonize` | 1.00 | Default — works for ~70% of layers |
| 2 | `snap`(tol=0.5pt) → `linemerge` | 0.90 | Small float-precision gaps |
| 3 | `snap`(tol=2.0pt) → `linemerge` | 0.70 | Sloppy Make2D output |
| 4 | `snap`(tol=5.0pt) → `linemerge` | 0.60 | Risk: over-snapping merges separate shapes |
| 5 | `__POCHE_CLOSE__` user-marked closing layer | 0.95 | **Highest-fidelity escape hatch** — user draws a few segments in Rhino on a special layer that bridges known gaps |
| 6 | `concave_hull(densified, ratio=0.3-0.5)` | 0.55 | One lumpy polygon, OK for visual mass |
| 7 | Per-layer JSON override | 0.80 | `{"TEC_FOUNDATION": "bbox"}` |
| 8 | Axis-aligned bounding box | 0.30 | Last resort, never empty |

Empirical Make2D tolerance per McNeel forum thread: gaps from clipping-plane
intersections can reach **2–5 pt** when curves are near-parallel. Match
`Join` tolerance to `AbsoluteTolerance × 10`.

## Scoring a closure

A rescued closure is only as trustworthy as the fraction of it we did not
invent, so `bridge._confidence` measures the **length** the bridger had to
add, not the **number** of bridges it added.

Counting is the wrong unit for Make2D output. Make2D fragments a cut at its
corners, so the bridge count tracks the corner count: a stepped footing --
a spread pad with a pier the wood column bears on -- has eight corners,
needs eight ~10pt stubs, and drives `n_bridges / n_segments` to 1.0. The
count-based penalty then scored that closure, whose boundary is ~99% real
cut line, exactly as it scored a wholly invented one. The layer fell to
confidence 0.62, below the 0.85 injection threshold, and printed as outline
only -- the Day-1 `foundation_concrete_under_wood_column_left_footing` miss.

Measuring `inferred_length / (drawn_length + inferred_length)` scores the
same closure at 0.20 invented, and a closure that really is mostly guessed
(sparse fragments, one long span across a void) still scores below the
threshold and stays diagnostic-only. Ladder order is unchanged: this only
scores what the rungs already produce.

## Library notes

- **Shapely 2.x** native — covers strategies 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- **`alphashape`** PyPI — richer alpha control than shapely's `concave_hull`
- **`shapely.segmentize(line, max_segment_length=2.0)`** — densify before
  concave_hull so endpoints aren't sparse

Densify all segments before concave_hull; otherwise sparse points produce a
bad hull.

## Rhino-side fix (push to user before tool runs)

Best Rhino settings, in order of effectiveness:

1. Run `Make2D` then `Join` with `Tolerance=AbsoluteTolerance` on output
   curves before export
2. In `Make2D` options, enable **"Maintain source layers"** + **"Group output
   by source object"** ([McNeel docs](http://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/8/help/en-us/commands/make2d.htm))
3. For DXF export use the `2D Curves` scheme; PDFs lose join info
4. `SelDup` + `Join` as a cleanup macro after Make2D

This is a **prerequisite improvement**, not a fallback — push users to do
this first.

## Proposed `arch-lw` API (v0.4)

```python
# tool reports per-layer confidence + strategy used
arch-lw poche drawing.ai --report

# user supplies overrides for known-bad layers
arch-lw poche drawing.ai --override poche-overrides.json

# enable __POCHE_CLOSE__ layer merging
arch-lw poche drawing.ai --close-layer __POCHE_CLOSE__
```

The output JSON would emit per-fill metadata:

```json
{
  "layer": "TEC_FOUNDATION",
  "strategy": "concave_hull_0.3",
  "confidence": 0.55,
  "polygon_count": 1,
  "segment_count": 10
}
```

so the user's UI can flag low-confidence fills as warnings.
